# my-restaurant
This is the initial version of my web app for restaurant booking management. The web contains a single form that allows the customers input. 

- The frontend used a HTML file with CSS and Vanilla JavaScript (using plain JavaScript without any additional frameworks and libraries).
- The backend used Python with Flask, which integrated two data structures (queue and priority queue).
- The data is in-memory storage without using database meaning that user information gets lost when the server restarts.

The primary user interface looks like:
